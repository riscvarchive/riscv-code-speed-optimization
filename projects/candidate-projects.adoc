== Research

- link:linker-optimizations.adoc[extension of optimization in the linker]
- machine learning in the compiler

== Development

- a collection of general RISC-V link:gcc-optimizations.adoc[GCC optimizations]
- compiler (GCC/LLVM/IAR) optimization for upcoming extensions (B, V, P, J, etc)
- machine learning outside the compiler
- superoptimization

== Process

- FSF copyright assignment in RISC-V mirror repositories
- allocation of vendor specific linker relocations
- `-menable-experimental-extensions` option for GCC
- ongoing benchmarking (and regressions in benchmarking), including competitive analysis
- documentation, for example to facilitate writing a scheduler, what can be standardize/parameterized, what are the "hints" in RISC-V documentation
- buildbot infrastructure for open source CI and measurement
